    <h2>Purpose</h2>
    <p>
        Make an app to help first responders maintain their medical knowledge through daily questions.
        The app questions will be within the scope of a New Mexico First responder and aim to help these people
        study their scope and general procedures.
    </p>
    <h2>Plan</h2>
    <p>
        I will develop a question bank of 100 questions or more based on the NMEMS Bureau treatment guidelines.
        Once the app is ready in november the beta test would consist of MRC members who would be randomly 
        assigned in half, by licensed and non licensed as Drones - The Control or the Pilots - The Testers. 
        After 30 days they would be given a final test to see how well the Pilots did against the Drones, 
        to track how well it worked. With feedback the app will be refined and added to.
